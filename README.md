# About me 
My name is  Narayan and I am a masters' student in IRES.
Here is a link to my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nsg94/).

I am from the Golden State of California, which has been described thusly according to Mike Murphy, as found on [Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/California). 
>Whatever interesting things America have happened, they've happened first in California.

I am learning how to code for the first time. For most of my life I found coding to be the one academic subject that did not *click* for me, but I know that it is quite **useful** and so ***that is why I am here.***

Even though I have never coded, I have edited [Wikipedia](https://www.Wikipedia.org) for many years. The markup language used on Wikipedia is analogous but distinct. For example, in this R Markdown, a link to Wikipedia's homepage would go
>\[Wikipedia](en.wikipedia.org)

but in  Wiki Markup language, it would go 
>\[Wikipedia en.wikipedia.org]
