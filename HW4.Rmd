## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Exercise 1: Univariate Option 1
Let's compare two countries' life expectancy by year. For the sake of having a meaningful comparison, we can pick countries that are near each other, such as India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.

```{r}
uni_wide <- gapminder %>%
  filter(country == "India" | country == "Pakistan" | country == "Bangladesh") %>%
  select(year, country, lifeExp) %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols = year, 
              names_from = country, 
              values_from = lifeExp) %>%
  arrange(year)
 
uni_wide %>%
  select(year, "India_lifeExp" = India, "Pakistan_lifeExp" = Pakistan, "Bangladesh_lifeExp" = Bangladesh)
```

We can make a graph that compares the life expectancy of India and Paksitan. In doing so, we find that the countries' life expectancies increase in lockstep with each other.
```{r, fig.align='center'}
uni_wide %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = India, y = Pakistan)) +
  geom_point(colour = "blue", size = 2) +
  ylab("Pakistan life expectancy (years)") +
  xlab("India life expectancy (years)")
```

```{r, comment = NA}
uni_wide %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = (-year), 
               names_to = "country", 
               values_to = "lifeExp") %>%
  arrange(country)
```

Exercise 2: Univariate Option 1
```{r}
multi_wide <- gapminder %>%
  filter(country == "Japan" | country == "China") %>%
  select(country, year, lifeExp, gdpPercap) %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols = year, 
              names_from = country, 
              values_from = c(lifeExp, gdpPercap)) %>%
  arrange(year)
multi_wide %>%
  select(year, "Japan_lifeExp" = lifeExp_Japan, "China_lifeExp" = lifeExp_China, 
         "Japan_gdp" = gdpPercap_Japan, "China_gdp" = gdpPercap_China)
```
```{r, comment = NA}
multi_wide %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = (-year), 
               names_to = c(".value", "country"), 
               names_sep = "_") %>%
  arrange(country)
```



Exercise 3 
```{r}
guest <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT545-UBC/Classroom/master/data/wedding/attend.csv")
email <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT545-UBC/Classroom/master/data/wedding/emails.csv")
```

#3.1 Let's make a table with the guest name in one column and the email  address in the next.
```{r, comment = NA}
email <- email %>% 
  separate_rows(guest, sep = ", ") %>%
  rename("name" = guest)
DT::datatable(email)
```

# 3.2 Let's check if there are any emails we have which don't have corresponding guests on the guestlist. 
```{r, comment = NA}
email %>%
  anti_join(guest, by = "name") %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

# 3.3 Let's make a table and a guestlist that has all guests that we have emails for.
```{r}
guest %>%
  full_join(email, by = "name") %>%
  DT::datatable()
```
